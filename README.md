# recruiter-autoresponse
Based on the Medium Article entitled - "Career Advice Nobody Gave Me: Never ignore a recruiter" this repo has a copyable script which you can use to auto-respond to recruiters.

This is licensed under MIT so please feel free to fork and use as you'd like. 

If you like it, please consider leaving a github star.  I think that it would be super cool to see how many people this helps.

Hi <name>, 

Thanks so much for reaching out. I'm always interested in hearing about new and exciting opportunities.

As an ML practitioner I'm sure you understand I get a high volume of such messages. I'd love to continue this conversation - could you send along the company name, job description, and compensation range for this role?
 
I look forward to hearing from you, and thanks again for reaching out.
